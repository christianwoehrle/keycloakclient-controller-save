# keycloakclient-controller
The keycloakclient-controller **manages keycloak clients in independent keycloak installations**. 
 
To create a KeycloakClient in a Keycloak Installation, a **KeycloakClient-CustomResource** is created, and the keycloakclient-controller sees to creating, changing, deleting the KeycloakClient as specified with the CustomResource.


## Description

This Operator has it's origin from the [Legacy Keycloak Operator](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator).
If you look for the official KeycloakOperator from RedHat, please look into the [KeycloakOperator](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/operator).

The Operator is opinionated in a way that it expects that Keycloak and
the KeyclokRealm are already set up (i.e. with one of the available Helm Charts) and it only has
to handle the KeycloakClients for a Keycloak Installation and a specific realm.

This fits our need as we set up Keycloak and the realm with Helm, and we have a lot of microservices that require their own KeycloakClient.
The Microservices are deployed via Helm and it is easy to simply deploy a KeycloakClient Resource together with the other artefacts of the Microservice and let
the Operator handle the creation of the KeycloakClient in Keycloak.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
make install
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/keycloakclient-controller:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/keycloakclient-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
